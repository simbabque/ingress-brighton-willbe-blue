          <h2>Welcome to <br class="d-none d-lg-block"/>Echo: Brighton</h2>

          <p>The U.K. Ingress Resistance welcomes you to Brighton for our Echo series Anomaly on May 20th, where we host the first European Ingress Anomaly of 2023, and the only Echo event in Central Europe. This website aims to give you all the information you need to attend, enjoy your weekend and help us win.</p>

          <p>Brighton is a beautiful seaside town located at the South Coast of England in East Sussex. It has a rich Victorian history that is visible throughout the city, and is a popular location for day trips and beach holidays, especially for Londoners. It's easy to reach on national and international transport, has lots of hotels and traditional English Bed and Breakfasts, and there is lots to do besides playing Ingress.</p>

          <p>Apart from having a very English beach and a reasonably large version of the typical British seaside town pier sporting amusements, bars and even a full-size roller coaster, Brighton is also known as the LGBTQ+ capital of the UK. It is diverse, colourful and vibrant, with many pubs, bars and theatres. There is always live music going on somewhere, and you can find a great selection of craft beers on offer both in the town centre as well as in local pubs in residential neighbourhoods.</p>

                  <p>The nearest airport to Brighton is <a href="https://www.gatwickairport.com/">London Gatwick</a>
                    (LGW).
                    It is the home of Easy Jet with many cheap connections all over Europe. There are direct Gatwick
                    Express
                    and local trains from Gatwick to Brighton several times an hour. Please be advised that the specific
                    Gatwick Express tickets are more expensive than buying a regular ticket. You can take any train from
                    Gatwick,
                    and the slowest one takes well under an hour. See <a href="#by-train">below</a> for information on
                    trains.
                    If you prefer a coach, <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en">National Express</a> run coaches
                    from Gatwick into Brighton
                    right by the pier. See <a href="#by-coach">below</a> for information on coaches. Gatwick is closer
                    to
                    Brighton than it is
                    to London.
                  </p>

                  <p>The much larger <a href="https://www.heathrow.com/">London Heathrow</a> (LHR) has connections from
                    British Airways as well as mayor European carriers. It is about two hours
                    on a <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en">National Express</a> coach. See <a
                      href="#by-coach">below</a> for information on coaches.
                    It is also possible to take London's public transport to get to one of the train stations that
                    connect
                    to Brighton.
                    See <a href="#by-train">below</a> for information on trains.</p>

                  <p>You might be tempted to fly to <a href="https://www.london-luton.co.uk/">London Luton</a> (LTN)
                    because
                    of the cheap airlines that go there from your home town. There is a driect Thameslink
                    train from Luton that takes about two hours and runs every hour.</p>

                  <p>Although <a href="https://www.stanstedairport.com/">London Stansted</a>
                    (STN) is not the easiest option, it may be the only one available to you. The <a href="https://www.stanstedexpress.com/">Stansted Express</a> train needs a specific ticket that cannot be bought through the regular train websites <a href="#by-train">mentioned below</a>, and will be cheaper if bought well in advance. You then need to change to tube in London, and onto a train to get to Brighton. See <a href="#by-train">below</a> for trains. A much cheaper but longer option is to take the National Express coach and change in London, which
                    takes about 5 hours and is described in <a href="#by-coach">the coach section</a>. We don't recommend this airport if you have a choice.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>If you are coming from London, there are Southern and Gatwick Express trains from London Victoria
                    as well as Thameslink trains from London Bridge. The Thameslink pass through London on the way to
                    Brighton from both to Cambridge and Bedford.</p>
                  <p>
                    To buy tickets for train journes you can use <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">Trainline</a>
                    or <a href="https://trainsplit.com/">Trainsplit</a>. Both of them have very good phone apps, and
                    they
                    both apply what is called split ticketing. The train network in the UK is operated by lots of
                    different
                    companies, and the ticket structure is very different to the rest of Europe. It is often much
                    cheaper
                    to buy multiple smaller journeys on individual tickets than a straight A to B ticket. These websites
                    will do this for you, and you do not have to leave the train even if you have three different
                    tickets
                    for your route.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Tickets bought on the internet can either have a QR code inside your app or they need to be picked
                    up.
                    You can pick them up at any train station in advance or before you travel. You are given a code, and
                    need to go to a ticket machine with the payment card you used to pay for the tickets online. Put the
                    card in, enter the code and select all tickets to print. If you are coming from up north and you
                    have
                    done split ticketing, this might take a while. Be at the station early. Some stations have QR code
                    readers, and going from London to Brighton will work without printing tickets.
                  </p>

                  <p>UK train stations typically have gates to the platforms. You need to have a valid ticket to go
                    through
                    the gate. Remember that trains drive on the left.
                  </p>

                  <p>To plan your route from London, in particular if you arrive at an airport other than Gatwick, you
                    might
                    want to get the <a href="https://citymapper.com/">Citymapper</a> app. It has very good route finding
                    that includes trains and local Brighton buses and much nicer usability than Google Maps.
                  </p>

                  <p>If you want to come from the European mainland by train you will travel on the <a
                      href="https://www.eurostar.com/">Eurostar through</a> the Channel Tunnel. These tickets can be
                    bought
                    online directly, or as part of an Interrail ticket through your local train provider, such as
                    Deutsche
                    Bahn. The Eurostar does not have limitations on luggage and cabin lugage restrictions like planes
                    do. It
                    is also much better for the environment, but it takes longer than flying. The Eurostar arrives at
                    London
                    St Pancras International, where you can change to a Thameslink service to Brighton with no further
                    changes that takes a little over an hour.</p>

                      Express</a>. Coach number
                    <code>025</code> runs 15 times a day. It starts at London Victoria, goes to Heathrow Airport
                    Terminal 1,
                    2 &amp; 3 as well as Heathrow Airport Terminal 5, Gatwick Airport North and South, and then
                    Brighton.
                    The coach station in Brighton is located right by the pier in the city centre. Fares range from 5
                    pounds
                    when booked way in advance p to about 30 pounds per trip. You can buy a return trip for airport
                    transfer.
                  </p>

                  <p>The coach tickets are bound to a specific time slot. You can pay 5 pounds extra to get their Change
                    &amp; Go feature, which lets you take any available coach instead. This makes a lot of sense when
                    arriving at the airport, because flights might be late, there might be queues at the border or your
                    luggage might be delayed.</p>

                  <p>To come to the UK from mainland Europe there are various ferries as well as the Eurotunnel.</p>

                  <p>The <a href="https://www.eurotunnel.com/uk/">Eurotunnel</a> is the most obvious choice. You drive
                    your
                    car onto a train and watch some Netflix, and it only takes half an hour. You need to drive to Calais
                    to
                    use the tunnel. This is the best way to bring your dog.</p>

                  <p>To go from Calais to Dover by ferry, you need to use <a href="https://www.poferries.com/en">P &amp;
                      O</a>. There also used to be SeaFrance, but they have recently closed the route. On average there
                    are
                    sailings every two hours. This crossing takes a little over an hour.</p>

                  <p>If you are driving from the North of Central Europe and do not want to go to France, you can use <a
                      href="https://www.dfds.com/en-gb/passenger-ferries/ferry-crossings/ferries-to-france/dover-dunkirk">DFDS</a>
                    from Dunkirk to Dover. These ferries are slightly less frequent than the Calais ones and take two
                    hours,
                    but give you a longer break and might be slightly less busy at peak times.</p>

                  <p>
                    If you're coming from the Netherlands or the North of Germany, you can use the <a
                      href="https://www.stenaline.co.uk/routes/harwich-hook-of-holland">StenaLine</a> ferry from Hook of
                    Holland to Harwich. These sail twice a day, with one during the day and one over night, with cabins.
                    This is great if you travel in a larger group, because the cabins are comfortable and affordable and
                    you
                    can split the journey in two with additional time to rest. You need to plan about 4 additional hours
                    to
                    get from Harwich to Brighton. This includes a toll charge at the <a
                      href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-dartford-crossing-charge">Dartford Crossing</a> when to get over (or
                    under) the Thames on the M25 London orbital motorway. This can be paid online.</p>

                  <p>If you are coming from France, you can use the <a
                      href="https://www.dfds.com/en-gb/passenger-ferries/ferry-crossings/ferries-to-uk/dieppe-newhaven">DFDS</a>
                    ferry from Dieppe to Newhaven, which takes about 4 to 5 hours for the crossing and a quick half hour
                    drive down the coast to get to Brighton. There are two crossing per day.</p>

                  <p>Parking in Brighton is tricky. You might get parking with your accommodation. Most hotels and bed
                    and
                    breakfasts do not have actual parking spaces, but rather sell or give you permits for onstreet
                    parking
                    in a specific zone. These need to be displayed in your car, with one permit per day. These permit
                    cannot
                    be bought otherwise.</p>

                  <p>If you do not have parking with your hotel and you don't think you need your car in Brighton, you
                    can
                    use the <a
                      href="https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/travel-and-road-safety/travel-transport-and-road-safety/park-ride">Park
                      &amp; Ride at Withdean Sports Complex</a>, which is located on your way in from the A23 when you
                    come
                    down from London, and is free of charge. It has a good bus connection to the town centre.</p>

                  <p>If you're coming from the West, you can look for free parking near the Shoreham train station and
                    take
                    a train to go to Brighton, which is cheaper than central Brighton parking.</p>

                  <p>Onstreet parking in residential areas is available in most parking zones, but you need to hunt for
                    spots. Some parts of most streets have parking for residents only, but there are also short and long
                    term bays. Always read the signs and make sure you get the bays that have the very long time frame
                    on
                    them. These ammout to a full day including the bit where parking is free, and cost around 6 pounds.
                  </p>

                  <p>If you want a pre-booked parking space and cost is not an issue, there are <a
                      href="https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/brighton-centre-russell-road/">two NCP</a>
                    <a href="https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/brighton-theatre/">car parks</a> that allow
                    pre-booking. A whole day costs in excess of 30 Pounds.
                    The other underground parking garages and multi storey car parks in the city centre are mostly <a
                      href="https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/parking/paid-parking/car-parks">run by the council</a>. You
                    cannot pre-book them, but there is a good traffic
                    direction sytem that will guide you to one with free spaces. Again, expect around 30 Pounds for full
                    24
                    hours.
                  </p>

                  <p>We do not recommend parking right by the sea front, as these bays are very, very expensive, and
                    often
                    have no return for several hours.</p>

                  <p>
                    If you cannot find anything within your budget directly in Brighton, it may be worth looking at
                    towns
                    along the coast as well as up the railway line. This is especially useful if you don't intend to
                    stay
                    out long for socials in Brighton after the anomaly. Generally there is good public transport,
                    especially
                    on the weekend, which runs longer than average pub opening hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>The most obvious choice might be an airport hotel in at Gatwick airport. It has good links with the
                    train and the bus. If you stay for multiple nights, of course think about whether the train is
                    actually
                    cheaper than getting a room directly in Brighton.</p>
                  <p>Along that train there are various towns that also have hotels and bed and breakfasts. The local
                    trains
                    all stop in Hassocks, Burgets Hill, Haywards Heath and Three Bridges before they go to Gatwick
                    airport.
                    Along the train to the east you have Falmer and Lewes within an easily commutable distance, and
                    along
                    the train to the west there is Portslade, Shoreham-by-Sea, Lancing and Worthing within easy reach.
                    All
                    of these will also have buses that take slightly longer than the train.</p>
                  <p>Down the eastern coast towards Eastbourne there are several towns with lots of bed and breakfasts.
                    You
                    can look in Saltdean, Peacehaven, Newhaven and Seaford. There is a very regular bus between
                    Eastbourne
                    and Brighton city centre that is covered by the 5.50 GBP networkSaver ticket for a 24 hour period.
                    See
                    <a href="https://www.buses.co.uk/tickets">buses.com</a> for a list of all available tickets.
                    Brighton
                    buses allow tapping in and out with your credit card, so for single journeys and capping you do not
                    need
                    to buy a ticket in advance.
